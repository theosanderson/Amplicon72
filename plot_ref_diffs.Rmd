This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
scheme = read_tsv("./data/V4.bed", col_names =c("chromosome","start","end","name","e","strand"))



the_start = region-600
the_end =  region+600

scheme=scheme %>% filter(start>the_start)%>% filter(start<the_end)

region = 21986
top<-ggplot(scheme,aes(xmin=start,xmax=end,y=name))+geom_errorbarh()+xlim(the_start,the_end)+theme_bw()

differences = read_delim("./ref_differences.tsv",col_names = c("Genome","Position","Residue") ,delim=" ")
bottom = ggplot(differences,aes(x=Position,y=Genome,color=Residue))+geom_point()+xlim(the_start,the_end)+theme_bw()

top/bottom+  plot_layout(heights = c(1, 3))

differences %>% filter(Residue=="-")%>% filter(Position>the_start)%>% filter(Position<the_end)


```


```{r}
metadata = read_csv("./processed_metadata.csv")
metadata
t85 = read_delim("./t85.csv",delim=" ",col_names=c("sequence_name","position","residue"))
both = inner_join(metadata,t85)
both$week = lubridate::floor_date(both$sample_date,"weeks")
ggplot(both%>% filter(residue!="N"),aes(x=week,fill=residue))  +geom_bar(position="fill")

ggplot(both%>% filter(residue!="N"),aes(x=lineage,fill=residue))  +geom_bar(position="fill")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
